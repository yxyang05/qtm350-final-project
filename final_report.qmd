## Project Name: 

The overarching goal of this project is to evaluate global progress in equitable access to education from 2000 to 2020. We focus on whether less-developed regions have been catching up to the world average in school enrollment and whether gender disparities in these regions have narrowed over time. By combining regional and gender-disaggregated enrollment data, we assess whether international development efforts have contributed to convergence in both educational attainment and gender parity.
